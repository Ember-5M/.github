# Ember Roleplay! ðŸš“ðŸŒ†

## ðŸŒŸ About Us

We're a GTA 5 FiveM roleplaying server dedicated to building an enjoyable and immersive community. Along with providing a great RP experience, we occasionally release scripts to the public!

Ember is currently in development for 2.0, a massive update built on everything we learned from 1.0. With hundreds of hours poured into development, we're bringing a brand-new UI, a complete overhaul of civilian and criminal jobs, and exciting new features and mechanics never seen before in our previous version.

Expect bigger, better, and more immersive roleplay with Ember 2.0!
